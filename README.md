# code_refactor

Optimizing the html mostly involved changing div tags to a more semantically correct version, such as 'nav' for the navbar and 'aside' for the information presented on the right side. Alt tags were also added to images and a link was repaired. 

CSS was made more efficient by way of creating singular classes for groups of items in the html with identical styling that were previously using dedicated class styles for each item within the group of identical items. 

A title was added-- the name of the brand. 

Altogether this project was a clean up of, mostly, working code in order to create a cleaner layout of said code.
